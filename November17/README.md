# Musical Instrument
From the moment we learned how to use buzzers during class, I thought that making a launch pad would be fun. Although it would be hard to make a launch pad with the given materials, I decided to make a mini launch pad for this project. I set up two buttons, where one button makes a lower note and the other makes a higher note. For example, if the button 1 makes a sound of note c on the fourth octave, button 2 will make a sound of note c on the fifth octave.
