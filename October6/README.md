## Problems Faced
I have not been able to figure out how to change the data sheet into a .csv file, and therefore during the private meeting, Prof. Shiloh had made my data sheet into a data file. However, I have sent the data sheet that had a flaw in season 3, 2013-14. Without knowing how to convert the sheets into a .csv file, I have completed my program working well, except for one logic error, where the season 3 is drawing based on a wrong data since the .csv file needs to be fixed.
