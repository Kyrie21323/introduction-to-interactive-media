# Creating a data visualization or a generative text
## Overall Concept
A data visualization for two point shoots and three point shoots made, attempted, and the percentage for both shoots.

## Results

## Problems Faced
I have not been able to figure out how to change the data sheet into a .csv file, and therefore during the private meeting, Prof. Shiloh had made my data sheet into a data file. However, I have sent the data sheet that had a flaw in season 3, 2013-14. Without knowing how to convert the sheets into a .csv file, I have completed my program working well, except for one logic error, where the season 3 is drawing based on a wrong data since the .csv file needs to be fixed.

The data source for my .csv file is from [this website](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html).
Another reference for spliting lists after getting a data from .csv file was from [Prof.Aaron Sherwood's Github repository](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/textExamples/splitCommas/splitCommas.pde)
